## method: hashtable
- store all generalized neighbors in the hashtable
- check neighbors of searchword in the table

## code
```
class MagicDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        
    def generateWords(self, word):
        for i in range(len(word)):
            yield word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]

    def buildDict(self, dictionary: List[str]) -> None:
        self.dict = set(dictionary)
        self.count = collections.Counter(gen for word in dictionary for gen in self.generateWords(word))

    def search(self, searchWord: str) -> bool:
        return any(self.count[nei] > 1 or (self.count[nei] == 1 and searchWord not in self.dict) for nei in self.generateWords(searchWord))
```

## complexity
- time: O(LN^2) for build, L is length of dictionary, N is length of word, O(K^2) for search, K is length of searchword
- space: same as above
