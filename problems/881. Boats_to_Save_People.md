## method: sort + two pointer
- first sort people by weight, then choose people from two ends
- if two people fit in, increment count by one, else, move pointer at the larger side

## code
```
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        count = 0
        i = 0
        j = len(people) - 1
        while i <= j:
            if i == j:
                count += 1
                break
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                count += 1
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
                j -= 1
        return count
```

## complexity
- time: O(NlogN) (sort)
- space: O(N)
