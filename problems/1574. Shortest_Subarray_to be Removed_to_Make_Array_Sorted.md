## method: two pointer + greedy
- get the maximum nondecreasing sequence from left, record the index of last element
- get the maximum nondecreasing sequence from right, record the index of first element
- combine subset of two such that maximum length of nondecreasing subarray is obtained
- greedy search with two pointer, one is zero, the other is from starting index of second nondecreasing sequence

## code
```
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfShortestSubarray(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        n = len(arr)
        right = n - 1
        while left + 1 < n and arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]:
            left += 1
        if left == n - 1:
            return 0
        while right > left and arr[right] >= arr[right - 1]:
            right -= 1
        res = min(right, n - 1 - left)
        
        # greedy search longest subarray
        i = 0
        j = right
        while i <= left and j < n:
            if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
                res = min(res, j - i - 1)
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return res
```

## complexity
- time: O(n)
- space: O(1)
