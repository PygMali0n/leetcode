## method: DP
- dp array entry is the maximum number of string we can obtain by using current number of zeros and ones represented by index
- iterate string one by one, calculate zeros and ones in it, and update the dp array from previous string, only update the entry current ones and zeros can fit in
- to avoid use current string multiple times, we start from the last possible entries, so that each update is made from previous string dp

## code
```
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        def countzeroones(s):
            zero = 0
            one = 0
            for i in list(s):
                if i == "0":
                    zero += 1
                else:
                    one += 1
            return zero, one
        for string in strs:
            zeros, ones = countzeroones(string)
            # prevent count duplicate string, start enumerating from last
            for i in range(n, ones-1, -1):
                for j in range(m, zeros-1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-ones][j-zeros] + 1)
        return dp[n][m]
```

## complexity
- time: O(SL + SMN) (number of string S and average length of string L, M, N is maximum possible 1s and 0s)
- space: O(MN)
