## method: DP
- store longest common subsequence at index

## code
```
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        l1 = len(word1)
        l2 = len(word2)
        # each entry is longest common subsequence at i, j position at word1, word2
        dp = [[0]* (l2 + 1) for _ in range(l1+1)]
        for i in range(l1):
            for j in range(l2):
                if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])
        return l1 + l2 - 2 * dp[-1][-1]
