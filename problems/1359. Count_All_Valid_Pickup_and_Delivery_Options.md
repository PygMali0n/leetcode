# method: DP
- each n has some relation with n - 1 that is F(n) = F(n-1)* K (k is number of combinations to put one schedule in all spaces in F(n-1)

## complexity analysis
- O(n)
- O(1)

## code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        long res = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int space = 2*i - 1;
            int pos = space*(space+1) / 2;
            res = (res*pos) % ((int) (1e9 + 7));
        }
        return (int)res;
    }
};
```
