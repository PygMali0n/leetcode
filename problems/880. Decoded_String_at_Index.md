## method: backwards
- first get the size at the last position, then decrement it looping forwards
- every iteration,  k modular current size, if k becomes 0, it means that kth character is at last position of string

## code
```
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, S: str, K: int) -> str:
        size = 0
        for i in range(len(S)):
            if S[i].isdigit():
                size *= int(S[i])
            else:
                size += 1
        for i in range(len(S)-1, -1, -1):
            # get position of K at pre-repeated string
            K %= size
            # k is zero if at the last position of repeated string
            # find the last character once we hit the lastest added character
            if K == 0 and S[i].isalpha():
                return S[i]
            # update size
            if S[i].isdigit():
                size /= int(S[i])
            else:
                size -= 1
```

## complexity:
- time: O(n)
- space: O(1)
