## method: DP and bitmask
- for size1, using dfs and memo find minimum cost to connect all of them
- for size2, find remaining points and greedily connect them with minimum cost

## code
```
class Solution:
    def connectTwoGroups(self, cost: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        s1 = len(cost)
        s2 = len(cost[0])
        
        # save minimum cost connect each size2 point
        s2_min = [min(cost[i][j] for i in range(s1)) for j in range(s2)]
        
        # dfs minimum cost, find minimum cost connecting all size1 points
        # then use mask represent size2 and find unconnected point
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, mask):
            res = 0 if i >= s1 else float('inf')
            # connect remaining points in size2
            if i >= s1:
                for i in range(s2):
                    if mask & (1 << i) == 0:
                        res += s2_min[i]
                        
            # connect size1 with memo
            else:
                for j in range(s2):
                    res = min(res, cost[i][j] + dfs(i + 1, mask | (1 << j)))
            return res
        return dfs(0, 0)
```

## complexity
- time: O((n * 2^m) * m) (that many dp states and each state takes m times)
- space: O(n * 2^m)
