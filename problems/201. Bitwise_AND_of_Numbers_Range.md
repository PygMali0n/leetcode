# method: bit operation
- if m < n, then last bit should be 0 and 1
- so we can shift both to the right until they are equal, number of bit shifting is the number of 0 in the result

## complexity analysis
- time: O(n) number of bits in m
- space: O(1)

## code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (m != n) {
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            count++;
            if (m == 0 && n != 0) return 0;
        }
        return m << count;
    }
};
```
