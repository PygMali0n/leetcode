## key points
- use two pointer method to fill in numbers
- one pointer go through the array and find numbers to fill
- another pointer keep postion of the actual number to be added
- whenever first pointer find a number is not greater than the number two positions before, it means there are 3 consecutive numbers, the pointer should find a larger value
- then the other pointer remain the same position until a larger value to be filled in

## complexity analysis
- time: O(n)
- space: O(1)

## C++ code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int pointer = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (pointer < 2 || nums[pointer-2] < n) {
                nums[pointer++] = n;
            }
        }
        return pointer;
    } 
};
```
