# method: binary search
- first look at the range of the problem, at least 10^5, so use at least use nlogn algorithms
- second, find the relation between ball and max min distance, if we increase the number of balls,
there should be less maximum min distance, so that is a monotonical function
- to have a max min distance, you should have a max number of balls to satisfy, because if fewer balls are used, min distance can be extended.
- so should define a count balls function based on max min distance, and perform binary search on distance.

## complexity analysis
- time: O(nlogm) (n is number of positions, m is max distance between two ends)
- space: O(1)

## c++ code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        int n = position.size();
        int l = 0, r = position[n-1] - position[0];
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = r - (r - l) / 2;
            if (count(mid, position) >= m) {
                l = mid;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
    
    int count(int dis, vector<int>& position) {
        int cnt = 1, curr = position[0];
        for (int p : position) {
            if (p - curr >= dis) {
                cnt++;
                curr = p;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
