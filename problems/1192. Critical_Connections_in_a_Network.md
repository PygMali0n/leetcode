# method: dfs
- store lowest rank /depth of each node from starting node
- an edge to a child node is critical only if it has not been reached before

## code
```
class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def dfs(res, current_rank, minimum_rank, graph, curr, prev):
            minimum_rank[curr] = current_rank
            for neighbor in graph[curr]:
                # skip coming back to current node
                if neighbor == prev:
                    continue
                # rank is 0 if the node have not been visited
                if minimum_rank[neighbor] == 0:
                    dfs(res, current_rank + 1, minimum_rank, graph, neighbor, curr)
                # update lowest depth/rank of current node by its neighbors
                minimum_rank[curr] = min(minimum_rank[curr], minimum_rank[neighbor])
                if minimum_rank[neighbor] == current_rank + 1:
                    res.append([curr, neighbor])
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        minimum_rank = [0] * n
        for i, j in connections:
            graph[i].append(j)
            graph[j].append(i)
        res = []
        dfs(res, 1, minimum_rank, graph, 0, -1)
        return res

## complexity
- time: O(E+V)
- space: O(E+V)
